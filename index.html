						<span class="firstPara"> <p >Hello! My name is <b>Jake Powis</b> & iv'e recently entered start up land after leaving a nearly 10 year career in banking (most recently 3 years at <a href="https://www.svb.com/uk" style="color: darkorange">Silicon Valley Bank</a>, lending to UK based tech companies) and am now hoping to join the Spring 2020 FAC cohort to get my (very limited) coding skills up to speed in order to support my ambition of pivoting my career into working with early stage tech companies - with the ultimate aspiration of founding & running a London based Fintech or Edtech business. <br><br>I'm excited to move into a position where I'm able to create real tangible products that deliver a true positive social impact, where banking has always felt one step removed from any end product, and is ultimately a quite self-serving industry. I want to use my experience and knowledge to support in making the availability of financial services, education and funding more widespread and accessible, where i feel the traditional finance system doesn't currently best serve the interests of everyone equally. I'm also excited about the opportunity to integrate myself with the FAC developer community, share ideas, learn loads, and then be in a position to contribute back to the programme to help support the education of future cohorts to come.</p></span>
						<br/>
						<span class="thankYou"><p><strong><span class="thankYou2">Thank you for taking the time to read my application & look at my first ever website!</span></strong></p></span>

				    <div id="tlBtn"><h3 align="center">THE EARLY YEARS<br/><i><small>pre-2009</i></small></h3></i></div>
					    <div class="tlText" align="justify">
					      <p>I grew up in a working-class entrepreneurial family on the South Coast of England and spent most of my youth playing bass guitar in bands and waay too many video games. While i struggled in early education, after re-dedicating myself to learning in my later years i become one of the first members of my family to go to university, and managed to graduate from the University of Sussex in 2009 with a 1st class hons degree in Economics (with some electives in Japanese language).</p>

				    <div id="tlBtn2"><h3 align="center">JAPAN<br/><i><small>2009-2010</i></small></h3></i></div>
				    <div class="tlText2" align="justify">
				      <p> After graduation, my adventurous side took over and i traveled to Japan (Nagoya) and found a job teaching English in a conversational English school (teaching all levels, from kids to business people). I also continued my own self education in Japanese language, which included spending some time living with a Japanese family & attending an intensive Japanese language school in Okazaki. </p>

				    	<div class="tlText3" align="justify">
				      <p> After a year in Japan, i returned home and got accepted to the HSBC Graduate Scheme. Once completed i become a junior Associate in the Corporate Bank, spending 3 years supporting the overseas & export growth of international focused businesses in Kent, and then later moved to Bristol and spent 3 years providing funding to Private Equity & Venture Capital in their acquisitions of business based across the west of England & Wales. </p>

				      	<div class="tlText4" align="justify">
				      <p>Being interested in Technology, in 2016 i made the move to Silicon Valley Bank in London, a tech & innovation focused bank that specialise in lending to Start-ups and Venture Capital backed companies. During my 3 years at SVB i moved from Senior Associate to Senior Vice President, having the opportunity to work with and support some really great UK & European based tech companies, and was even able to spend time in San Fran, San Diego, Palo Alto, Boston & Chicago to really understand the startup/tech culture in the US.</p>

						<h2> A Little About Me </h2>
						<p> My hobbies include Travel, Yoga, Fitness, Nature & watching eSports. I recently got back from 3 months living in Vietnam, where via Udemy i learnt the basics of how to code in <span class="highlight">MQL4</span> (a financial automation coding language based on C++) in order to develop automated trading robots which has been a hobby of mine over the last few years (however i've mainly dealt with the financial side of the project, and always had a coder friend produce the code). Since getting back in October, i was able to develop some very basic robots using my own MQL4 code, and had then started learning some very simple <span class="highlight">Python</span> with the aim to use the language to support the testing, analysis and optimization of these algorithms.</p>
						<p> Post the trip iv'e fallen in love with coding, which is exactly what my mind needed after so many years in a rigid Corporate job - i really enjoy the creativity and freedom of the problem solving, the intellectual challenge and stimulation, and the reward of seeing it all come together. I found out about the FAC programme in November and decided it was a great incentive to bring my web dev learning forward  with a view to get selected for the course, so switched my coding focus and am now loving learning <span class="highlight">JavaScript, HTML & CSS</span> from scratch. Iv'e already learnt loads just by completing the pre-requisites for this programme, i feel like my coding has come such a long way in such a short space of time, and am really excited to continue this journey and learn so much more.</p>
						<p> Finally, let me introduce to you the love of my life, <span class="highlight">Pippa</span>, my 4 month old African Pygmy Hedgehog - so please enjoy some cute hedgehog pictures as part of the Image Carousel part of the the pre-reqs!</p>

					<h2 align="center"> Why FAC</h2> 
					<ul>
						<li><b>Peer Learning </b>
							<ul>
								<li>FAC offers the ability to <b>learn from your peers</b> in a group environment, something which is incredibly exciting and i believe being in a group full of bright, diverse and dedicated minds will not only be a tremendously effective and motivating way to learn coding skills, but also to develop stronger skills in teamwork, cooperation and communication. Iv'e been lucky enough to experience this first hand at the FAC Monday meet-ups, and have always walked away having learnt so much more than from an equivalent self learning session.</li>
								<li> I also love the <b>Social Enterprise</b> nature of FAC which creates a virtuous circle of free education for those who most need it and are willing to work hard for it. As someone from an industry dominated by wealth and privilege, nothing makes me more passionate than being able to support equality of opportunity for all, regardless of background or education. </li>
								<li>FAC also embodies <b>diversity</b>, perhaps also something lacking in my previous industry - this programme creates an environment of diverse thought and perspective, and i am therefore not only excited to bring my own unique perspective to the group, but to also learn from my mentors and fellow students, all of which from a variety of nationalities, experiences, and backgrounds. </li>
							</ul>
						<li><b>Peer Teaching</b> - One of the big draws of the programme is the ability to get back in the class room and pass on my learnings to future intakes. Teaching is something i really enjoy and has played a big role in all of my jobs, experiences include:
							<ul> 
								<li>One year of full time <span class="highlight">teaching</span> of conversational English at a Language School in Japan.</li>
								<li>Providing Graduate <span class="highlight">education</span> at Silicon Valley Bank, including designing & delivering 6hrs of class room learning to all new graduates & interns as part of their 1st year curriculum. </li>
								<li>Involved in new grad and intern recruitment interviews and assessment centers at both HSBC & SVB, as well as facilitating many on-campus grad employment and finance <span class="highlight">skills workshops</span> across various Universities and High schools across London and Kent as HSBC community outreach. </li>
								<li>Other experience includes <span class="highlight">coaching</span> new rowers on the  Sport England backed "Learn to Row" programme at my old rowing club in Bristol, <span class="highlight">tutoring</span> Economics and Statistics at university, and ongoing informal <span class="highlight">mentorship</span> for a number of mentees of various backgrounds.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li><b>To build something that matters</b>. As part of my transition out of the world of banking, i'm excited to work with new start ups on their ideas, with the ambition to work with companies that offer a positive social impact and disrupt traditional finance, with the ultimate aim of one day building something of my own once i have the skills and experience. Current <b>ideas</b> for my own start-up projects include: 

				<div id="grid-container" align="justify">
					<div id="grid-1">
					<span class="ideaHeading">Finance Education Platform</span><br/>I'm passionate about giving people equal opportunity and access to career opportunities, and while improving, unfortunately the current state of the finance industry often doesn't offer this (with connections and formal education often being the definitive factors in recruitment). <br><br>Using my experience in recruiting and training grads, it should be possible to develop an Online Education Platform that provides a full web-based curriculum of free finance career-focused educational courses in interactive bite-size user friendly lessons (like free code camp, but for Finance) that would expand opportunity to entry level positions in finance and provide and more even playing field for those without higher educations to gain knowledge on practical financing concepts and techniques for free, that could help them get a foot on the ladder in the industry. <br> <div class="ideaContainer"><div class="ideaIcon"><i class="fas fa-user-graduate"></i></i></div> </div>				
					</div>
					<div id="grid-2">
					<span class="ideaHeading">Web-tools for Early Stage Businesses </span><br/> There is often a disparity of information and knowledge in early stage businesses when raising finance or equity, leading to more lender/equity favored outcomes in these negotiations. Building out a public access library of interactive web based tools and information based on what Financial Institutions and Equity providers use could help level the playing field hugely benefit companies when making these decisions (examples include Tools such as bespoke Debt capacity calculator & cashflow forecasters that utilize scrapping of financial statements for personalized results, or providing access to interactive standard legal document templates & explanations of key negotiation areas, with web based coaching on the practical impact of these on the business post deal). <br><br>Providing these kind of tools and education to companies in a user friendly way would help them to safely borrow or raise money and allow them to get the best deal for the business and employees in any funding round. <br> <div class="ideaContainer"><span class="ideaIcon"><i class="fas fa-tools"></span></i></div>
					</div>
					<div id="grid-3">
					<span class="ideaHeading"> Disruptive Fintech</span> <br>Finteh is an exciting area, and i would love to create or work with companies providing new avenues to finance and banking products to those with traditionally limited access. London is a hub of FinTech companies, and I'd be excited to be able to use my experience and knowledge of traditional finance, alongside my coding and development skills in order to support more tech-driven, creative and socially responsible approaches to providing financing. <br><br>I'm also extremely interested in Edtech given my experience and interest in education, and would love to work with a tech company that supports open access to education, as i feel strongly that this is one of the strongest drivers to increasing social equality.<br><br>I'm also passionate about promoting mental and physical health, so would welcome the opportunity to work on projects in these areas.<div class="ideaContainer"> <span class="ideaIcon"><i class="fas fa-globe"></i></span></div></div>
