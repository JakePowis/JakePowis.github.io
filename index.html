						<h2 class="headings"> My Application to the FAC Spring 2020 Cohort </h2> 
						<p >Hello! My name is <b>Jake Powis</b> & iv'e recently entered start up land after a c.10 year career in banking (most recently 3 years at <a href="https://www.svb.com/uk" style="color:#FF9F55">Silicon Valley Bank</a>) and am looking to join the spring cohort to get my (very limited) coding skills up to speed in order to support my aspirations of founding a London based fintech company! 
						<br/>
						<p> My goal from this programm is therefore to develop strong coding skills, intergrate myself into the developer community, start building out my start-up ideas (see <a href="#FAC" style="color:darkgrey">FAC</a> section for more details!), and hopefully then be in a position to give back to the community through the peer teaching element of this programme.
						<br/>
						<p>Thank you for taking the time to read my application & look at my first ever website!</p>

				<h2 class="headings"> A Little About Me </h2>
				<p> My hobbies include Travel, Yoga, Fitness & watching eSports. I recently got back from 3 months living in Vietnam, where via Udemy i learnt the basics of how to code in <span class="highlight">MQL4</span> (a financial automation coding lanaguge based on C++) in order to develop trading robots which has been a hobby of mine over the last few years (however i've mainly dealt with the financial side, and always had a coder friend produce the code). Since getting back in October, i was able to develop some very basic robots using my own MQL4 code, and had then started learning some very simple <span class="highlight">Python</span> with the aim to support the testing, anaysis and optimisation of these bots.</p>
				<p> Post the trip, iv'e a new found love for coding, which is exactly what my mind needed after so many years in a constraining Corporate job - i really enjoy the creativity and freedom of the problem solving, the intelectual challenege and stimulation, and the reward of seeing it all come together. I'm now loving learning <span class="highlight">JavaScript</span> from scratch and i'm already addicted to codewars. Iv'e already learnt loads just by completing the pre-requesitites for this programm and am really excited to continue this journey and learn so much more.</p>
				<p> Finally, let me introduce to you the love of my life, <span class="highlight">Pippa</span>, my 4 month old African Pgmy Hedghog - so please enjoy some cute hedgehog pictures as part of the image Carosel part of the the pre-reqs!</p>

			<h2 class="headings">Why FAC</h2> 
			<ul style="font-size:15px">
				<li><b>Peer Learning </b>
					<ul>
						<li>FAC offers the ability to <b>learn from your peers</b> in a group enviroment, something which is incredibly exciting and i beleive being in a group full of bright, diverse and dedicated minds will not only be a tremedously effective and motivating way to not only learn coding skills, but also develop stronger skils in teamwork, cooporation and communication.</li>
						<li> I also love the <b>Social Enterpirse</b> nature of FAC which creates a virtuous circle of free education for those who most need it and are willing to work hard for it. I am looking forward to giving back to the programm in the future. </li>
						<li>FAC also embodies <b>diversity</b>, perhaps something lacking in my previous industry (banking) - this programm creates an enviroment of diverse thought and perspective, and i am therefore exicited to learn from my teachers and fellow students, all of which from a vareity of nationalities, experiences, and backgrounds. </li>
					</ul>
				<li><b>Peer Teaching</b> - One of the big draws of the programm is the ability to get back in the class room and pass on my learnings to future intakes. Teaching is something i really enjoy and has played a big role in all of my jobs, experiences include:
					<ul> 
						<li>One year of full time <span class="highlight">teaching</span> in conversational English in Japan at a Language School;</li>
						<li><span class="highlight">Graduate education</span> at Silicon Valley Bank(including 6 hour course deisgned & delivered by myself to all new grads). Was also heavily involved in all new grad and intern recruitment interviews and assement centres;</li>
						<li>Delivered on campus grad employment <span class="highlight">educational workshops</span> while at HSBC accross various London univerisites, as well as attended all the major grad recruitment fairs representing HSBC. </li>
						<li><span class="highlight">Coaching</span> new rowers on the "Learn to Row" programme at my old rowing club in Bristol;</li>
						<li><span class="highlight">Tutoring</span> Economics and Statistics at university;</li>
						<li>And currently ongoing informal <span class="highlight">mentorship</span> for 4 mentees.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><b>To build something</b>, as part of my transition out of full time employment , im excited to build something. Current ideas include: <ul>

					<!-- oranage boxes for each of these 4-5 ideas -->
					<li><b>Client front end</b> for propritoy algorithmic trading robots - the robot part is something iv'e been developing with a coder friend over the last two years - but the project could use a front end for client interaction (portfolio tracking, reallocation fund withdrawl etc)</li> 
					<li>Cloud based <b>Financial modeling tools</b> for instiutions (you'd be supprised to hear most of the big instiutions still use janky excel spreadsheets, so there could be a oppotunity here)</li>
					<li><b>Online tools to support early stage businesses </b>> - Propirotiry Debt capacity calulator (& forecaster) utilising scrapping of financial statements - providing education to companies on their debt capacity and how to safley borrow  // Web based M&A tools, resources, advice & education for companies preparing to sell / raise money so they are able to get the best deal in any funding round / dillutio</li>
					<li><b>Meta data agregator</b> for publically available credit (i.e metacritic for company credit ratings) inc web scrapping for data</li>
					<li>Alternativlaly, post the progrmme i'd be open to supporting a founder with their idea and working on the business / financial side using my Financ experience, but also being able to add value through supporting code base / feedback / QA with what i've learnt</li>
