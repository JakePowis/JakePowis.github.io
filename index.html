						<h2> My Application to the FAC Spring 2020 Cohort </h2> 
						<p >Hello! My name is <b>Jake Powis</b> & iv'e recently entered start up land after a nearly 10 year career in banking (most recently 3 years at <a href="https://www.svb.com/uk" style="color: darkorange">Silicon Valley Bank</a>) and am looking to join the spring cohort to get my (very limited) coding skills up to speed in order to support my aspirations of pivoting into fintech and hopefully one day founding a London based fintech company! </p>
						<br/>
						<p> My goal from this programme is therefore to develop strong coding skills, integrate myself into the developer community, start building out my start-up ideas (see <a href="#FAC" style="color:darkorange">FAC</a> section for more details!), and hopefully then be in a position to give back to the community through the peer teaching element of this pro gramme.</p>
						<br/>
						<p><strong>Thank you for taking the time to read my application & look at my first ever website!</strong></p>

				      <h3 align="center">TH EARLY YEARS<br/><i><small>pre-2009</i></small></h3>
				      <p>I grew up in a entrepreneurial family on the South Coast of England, spent most of my youth playing bass guitar in bands and waay too many video games. I graduated from the university of Sussex in Brighton in 2009 with a 1st class hons degree in Economics (with some electives in Japanese language).</p>

				      <h3 align="center">JAPAN <br/><i><small>2009-2010</small></i></h3>
				      <p> After graduation, i traveled to Japan (Nagoya) for a year to teach English in a conversational English school (teaching all levles, from kids to business men) and to better improve my Japanese, including spending some time living with a Japanese family & attending an intensive Japanese language school in Okazaki. </p>

				      <h3 align="center">HSBC <br/><i><small>2010-2016</i></small></h3>
				      <p> I returned home and got accepted to the HSBC Graduate Scheme, and once completed i become a junior Associate in the Corporate Bank, spending c.3 years supporting the overseas growth of International focused businesses in Kent, and then later moved to Bristol and spent c.3 years providing funding for Private Equity in their acquisitions of business based across the west of England & Wales. </p>

				      <h3 align="center">Silicon Valley Bank <br/><i><small>2016-2019</small></i></h3>
				      <p>Being interested in Technology, i made the move to Silicon Valley Bank in London, a tech & innovation focused bank that specialise in lending to Start-ups and Venture Capital backed companies. During my 3 years at SVB i moved from Senior Associate to Senior Vice President, having the opportunity to work with and support some really greak UK & European based tech companies, and was even able to spend time in San Fran, San Diego, Palo Alto, Boston & Chicago to really understand the startup/tech culture in the US.</p>

				      <h3 align="center">Founder<br/><i><small>2020 & beyond</small></i></small></h3>
				      <p>After a rewarding period at SVB working with great tech companies, the itch to start my own enterprise became too strong and in July'19 i left my role in order to pursue the idea of creating my own start up and have since been working on a number of projects. I have now come to the retaliation that developing my own coding skills would vastly aid my journey, and in assessing my options came across FAC which appears to be a great fit for me as an aspiring Tech-Founder.</p>

						<h2> A Little About Me </h2>
						<p> My hobbies include Travel, Yoga, Fitness, Nature & watching eSports. I recently got back from 3 months living in Vietnam, where via Udemy i learnt the basics of how to code in <span class="highlight">MQL4</span> (a financial automation coding language based on C++) in order to develop trading robots which has been a hobby of mine over the last few years (however i've mainly dealt with the financial side, and always had a coder friend produce the code). Since getting back in October, i was able to develop some very basic robots using my own MQL4 code, and had then started learning some very simple <span class="highlight">Python</span> with the aim to support the testing, analysis and optimization of these bots.</p>
						<p> Post the trip, iv'e a new found love for coding, which is exactly what my mind needed after so many years in a constraining Corporate job - i really enjoy the creativity and freedom of the problem solving, the intellectual challenge and stimulation, and the reward of seeing it all come together. I'm now loving learning <span class="highlight">JavaScript, HTML & CSS</span> from scratch since Novemeber'19, and i'm already addicted to codewars. Iv'e already learnt loads just by completing the pre-requisites for this programme and am really excited to continue this journey and learn so much more.</p>
						<p> Finally, let me introduce to you the love of my life, <span class="highlight">Pippa</span>, my 4 month old African Pygmy Hedgehog - so please enjoy some cute hedgehog pictures as part of the Image Carousel part of the the pre-reqs!</p>

					<h2 align="center"> Why FAC</h2> 
					<ul>
						<li><b>Peer Learning </b>
							<ul>
								<li>FAC offers the ability to <b>learn from your peers</b> in a group environment, something which is incredibly exciting and i believe being in a group full of bright, diverse and dedicated minds will not only be a tremendously effective and motivating way to not only learn coding skills, but also develop stronger skills in teamwork, cooperation and communication.</li>
								<li> I also love the <b>Social Enterprise</b> nature of FAC which creates a virtuous circle of free education for those who most need it and are willing to work hard for it. I am looking forward to giving back to the programme in the future. </li>
								<li>FAC also embodies <b>diversity</b>, perhaps something lacking in my previous industry (banking) - this programme creates an environment of diverse thought and perspective, and i am therefore excited to learn from my teachers and fellow students, all of which from a variety of nationalities, experiences, and backgrounds. </li>
							</ul>
						<li><b>Peer Teaching</b> - One of the big draws of the programme is the ability to get back in the class room and pass on my learnings to future intakes. Teaching is something i really enjoy and has played a big role in all of my jobs, experiences include:
							<ul> 
								<li>One year of full time <span class="highlight">teaching</span> in conversational English in Japan at a Language School;</li>
								<li><span class="highlight">Graduate education</span> at Silicon Valley Bank(including 6 hour course designed & delivered by myself to all new grads). Was also heavily involved in all new grad and intern recruitment interviews and assessment centres;</li>
								<li>Delivered on campus grad employment <span class="highlight">educational workshops</span> while at HSBC across various London univerisites, as well as attended all the major grad recruitment fairs representing HSBC. </li>
								<li>Other experience includes <span class="highlight">coaching</span> new rowers at my old rowing club in Bristol, <span class="highlight">tutoring</span> Economics and Statistics at university, and ongoing informal <span class="highlight">mentorship</span> for 4 mentees.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li><b>To build something</b>, as part of my transition out of full time employment , i'm excited to build something. Current <b>ideas</b> include: 

				<div id="grid-container">
					<div id="grid-1">
					<b>Client front end for propritoy algorithmic trading robots </b><br/><br/> The robot part is something iv'e been developing with a coder friend over the last two years - but the project could use a front end for client interaction (portfolio tracking, reallocation fund withdrawal etc)
					</div>

					<div id="grid-2">
					<b>Cloud based Financial modeling tools for institutions </b> <br/><br/>you'd be surprised to hear most of the big institutions still use janky excel spreadsheets, so there could be a opportunity here)
					</div>

					<div id="grid-3">
					<b>Online tools to support early stage businesses </b> <br/><br/>Propitiatory Debt capacity calculator (& forecaster) utilising scrapping of financial statements, legal document templates - providing education to companies on to safley borrow / raise money so they are able to get the best deal in any funding round.
					</div>

					<div id="grid-4"><b>Meta data aggregator for publicly available credit ratings</b> <br/><br/> i.e metacritic for company credit ratings) inc web scrapping for data - idea to be refined!
					</div>
			</div>
			<p>Alternatively, post the programme I'd be open to working with other founders who have their own ideas for creating a business, with me providing both support on the business / financial / fund raising side using my Finance experience, as well as provide hands on support on the code base. Whatever my next steps as i enter the world of start ups, my experience with FAC will be invaluable in supporting me to create a successful tech company here in London.</p>
