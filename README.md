# JakePowis.github.io

- Repository for my 1 page website for my Founders & Coders Spring 2020 application (hosted on Git Pages).

- The website contains links to my CodeWars, FreeCodeCamp and this repository. 

- It also cover the other pre-requisites of application such as a image carousel that includes autoplay & key press functionality.

- <b>Thank you for taking the time to look at my application!</b>

- <i>Note: This repository has been an iterative work in progress since coding my first line of JS, CSS & HTML in November, so please forgive that it's a bit messy! I’ve learnt a lot making this site, so if i did it all again I’d organise it all a bit better and cut down on number of files to make it all a bit more coherent, so apologies that its all over the place at the moment!   </i>
